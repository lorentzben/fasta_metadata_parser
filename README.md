# FASTA metadata parser

This parser takes a FASTA file as input and calculates both scaffold and contig statistics (N50, L50, etc.) from a scaffold FASTA file. It does this by breaking each scaffold wherever there is more than one `N` and then calculating statistics for both the scaffolds and contigs.

It requires NumPy and [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org). Both of which can be easily obtained from the [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution.

####Usage:

To run the parser, simply add it to the directory with your FASTA file and issue the command:

```
$ python fasta_meta_data_parser.py <fasta_file_name>
```

It will then write the stats to the screen. It will look something like this:

```
